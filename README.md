🗣️ Tambayan ng Tinig (Voice Hangout)
Tambayan ng Tinig is a resident feedback and sentiment management system developed using Visual Basic 2008.

Standardized Data Entry: Optimized for fast and reliable data submission using standard input hardware.

Validation & Constraints: * Strict input masking for contact numbers (11 digits).

Numeric-only restrictions for Block and Lot fields.

Character limit of 80 for subject lines to ensure conciseness.

Adaptive Address Formatting: The interface dynamically adjusts address guides based on the selected area—such as Harmony Hills or Pabahay 2000—to ensure the data matches the specific layout of the neighborhood.

Sentiment Categorization: Residents can classify their input as a Suggestion, Complaint, Feedback, or Others.

Auto-Reference Generation: The system instantly generates a unique Reference Number (e.g., MZN-2025-HAR-C001) for every submission.


Admin Dashboard (Official Side):
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Secure login with distinct permissions for Admin, Secretary, and Captain accounts.

Comprehensive Audit Trails: * Account Logs: Monitors login and logout times for security auditing.
